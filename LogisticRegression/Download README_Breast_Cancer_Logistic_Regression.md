# ðŸ“˜ Breast Cancer Diagnostics using Logistic Regression

This notebook presents a complete end-to-end analysis of the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** using **logistic regression**. It aims to build a predictive model to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on cell nuclei features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Dataset ID**: 17  
- **Classes**:  
  - `0`: Benign  
  - `1`: Malignant  
- **Features**: 30 real-valued measurements (e.g., radius, texture, concavity, symmetry)

---

## ðŸ§ª Objective

To train and evaluate a logistic regression model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases, while interpreting the influence of each feature and analyzing the effect of regularization and solver choices.

## âœ… Workflow Summary

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Retrieved using `ucimlrepo` package.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Checked class distribution.
- Visualized relationships via heatmaps.
- Identified multicollinearity.

### 3. **Preprocessing**
- Handled class imbalance.
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.

### 4. **Modeling**
- Used `LogisticRegression` within a `Pipeline`.
- Compared multiple solvers: `liblinear`, `lbfgs`, `saga`, `sag`, `newton-cg`.

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Displayed confusion matrix and ROC-AUC.
- Performed solver comparison via cross-validation.

### 6. **Feature Analysis**
- Extracted and visualized:
  - Model coefficients
  - Odds ratios
  - Top influential features

### 7. **Regularization Strength Analysis**
- Compared model performance for different `C` values to find the best regularization level.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- All solvers performed similarly (~98% accuracy).
- `concave_points`, `area`, and `radius` were the most predictive features.
- Ideal regularization strength was around `C = 0.1 to 1`.
- Model performed well even with mild class imbalance.
